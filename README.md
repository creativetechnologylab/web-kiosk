# Web Kiosk

A little application for running a web technology based project in a 'exhibition' like environment.

## Features

- Full screen
- No browser window
- Can run servers

## Usage

Just open the application (can be downloaded from the releases page <https://github.com/creativetechnologylab/web-kiosk/releases>) and on first open you will be presented with a popup asking you to choose a file/enter a URL.

You can either enter a remote URL, or a local file/URL and it will infer how to run it and run it.

Optional input for port number, if needed and also whether or not this data should be persisted for this machine.

## When app is running

The interactions within the app are purposefully _hard_ because they are meant to withstand being in an exhibition environment.

The commands are:

- **shift + `** Press this multiple times very quickly. Gets the popup to appear again
- **shift + t** Press this multiple times very quickly. An alternative way to quit (in case cmd + q was tied up for some reason)
- **cmd + q** Quit the app

## How to run from start up
TODO HONESTLY ILL DO IT SOON
